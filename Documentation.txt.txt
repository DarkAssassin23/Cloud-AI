This is a semi-smart, cloud-based AI system designed to make your life easier.
Commands:
	calendar
		this command will return the calendar for the current month

	date
		this command will return the current date to the user in MM/DD/YYYY format

	exit
		this command closes your connection to the server

	hello there
		this command will give you a Star Wars prequals reference

	how are you
		this command will result in the AI telling you how they are feeling at that moment
		There are multiple  feelings it can feel so feel free to see if you can find them all

	i am 
		this command lets the AI know you you are and will address you by that name (when applicable)
		though out the course of your connection to the server

	ipconfig or ifconfig
		by entering either of these commands you will receive your local IP
		as well as your global IP. 
		NOTE: depending on the machine this is running on it may give back a local ip
        		that is NOT your local network ip address. For example, while testing this
        		method on a windows machine it would return a virtual ethernet adapter in
        		this case it was 168.254.170.7 while the actual local ip was 192.168.1.6
        		On one of the linux computers this was tested on it returned the loopback
        		ip instead of the local ip, however on a different linux computer it worked
        		fine and on the mac computer it was tested on it also worked fine.
        		However, to fix this problem on windows it is simply a problem with the binding 
			order of your network adapters, so by changing the binding order of the network
        		adapters this will fix the problem. On linux, the solution is simple, in your
			/etc/hosts/ file make sure your hostname is the local ip and not the loopback
			adapter
	
	time
		this command will return the current time to the user in military time

	to binary
		this command takes a base 10 number followed by to binary and returns to you the binary representation
		of that base 10 number

	to hex
		this command takes a base 10 number followed by to hex and returns to you the hexadecimal representation
		of that base 10 number
